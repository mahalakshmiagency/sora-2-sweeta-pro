## About

SORA 2 is a State-of-the-art model by OpenAI and for the past few days, being on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, I've noticed how many non-technical people just assume the video is real despite the watermark.

Think what would happen if there was no watermark?
This is the reason that this project exists. It's not to abuse the great initiative by OpenAI to put logos onto every generation (though temporarily there's also an easy way to bypass that which I wouldn't cover), it's to hopefully encourage them to be harsher and more obvious with it in some form.

Sweeta is an AI-powered watermark removal tool specifically designed for SORA 2 video generations. It Uses advanced inpainting models (LaMA) and intelligent detection algorithms, it can seamlessly remove watermarks while (mostly) preserving the original image quality.
